Bayesian Network :
Bayesian Networks are probabilistic graphical models and they have some neat features which make them very useful for many problems. They are structured in a way which allows you to calculate the conditional probability of an event given the evidence. The graphical representation makes it easy to understand the relationships between the variables and they are used in many AI solutions where decisions need to be automated in a range of contexts such as medical diagnosis, risk modelling and mitigation. Bayesian networks are great where the is a complex system of many causal relationships

CPT:
Conditional probability table (CPT) is defined for a set of discrete and mutually dependent random variables to display conditional probabilities of a single variable with respect to the others.
